Pseudorandom Number Generators: Understanding Their Functionality, Common Types, and Cryptographic Insecurity
# Exploring Cybersecurity Threats in Modern Web Applications

## Introduction

I conducted a research project exploring pseudo-random number generators and their cybersecurity applications. The study investigated their functionality, common types, and cryptographic vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of robust randomness in various domains. I produced a research paper and presented findings in accessible language to peers, classmates, and professors of all technical backgrounds.


## Abstract

Web applications are increasingly targeted by cyber attacks due to their widespread use and the sensitive data they handle. This study investigates common vulnerabilities, analyzes recent security breaches, and recommends best practices for securing web applications.
